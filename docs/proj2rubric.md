|Bonus: Xfold improvement|2|We have tackled scalability from various avenues. First we added a functionality to onboard new doctors and hospitals allowing for a higher availability of the application. Also, we tackled scalability from the perspective of time spent by a customer. Previously, when user wanted to book an appointment, it'd have taken over a minute, but now it takes 18 seconds.|
